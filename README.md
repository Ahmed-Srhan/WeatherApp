# WeatherApp
is a Weather Forecast app using OpenWeatherMap API

## Technology Used

- Clean Architecture (MVVM)
- Dagger-hilt to handle dependency injection.
- Co-routines to deal with threads.
- Flow & StateFlow to give view the data and notify it when a change occurs.
- Retrofit2 & OkHttp3 to handle apis requests.
- Shared preferences to store the city name and when app exits, they are cleared
- Data binding instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that.
- Glade to load images from internet.
- CardView, RecyclerView
